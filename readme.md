## 3. Intermediate Concepts

### 3.1. Arrays and Strings
- Arrays (1D, 2D, and Multidimensional)
- String Handling (C-style strings, `std::string`)
- Array and String Manipulation

### 3.2. Pointers
- Introduction to Pointers
- Pointer Arithmetic
- Pointers and Arrays

- Iterators
- Algorithms (Sorting, Searching, etc.)
- Functors and Lambda Expressions

## Advanced Practice Problems 
### [Strive AtoZ sheet](https://takeuforward.org/strivers-a2z-dsa-course/strivers-a2z-dsa-course-sheet-2)
#NOTE: These problems are supposed to be done only when you are done with the above problems and are able to solve them at their own. In the below problem sheet, first solve the easy problems of all the below mentioned topics. The topics to be done from this sheet are :

- Step 1 : Learn the basics
- Step 2 : Learn Important Sorting Techniques
- Step 3 : Solve Problems on Arrays [Easy -> Medium -> Hard]
- Step 5 : Strings [Basic and Medium]
- Step 7 : Recursion [PatternWise]

#NOTE: Method to solve a problem:
- Take a pen and paper
- Understand the problem
- look at the constraints of the problem
- understand what you have to return as output
- figure out the logic of the problem on paper
- write a pseudo-code of your solution
- now write the actual code in the editor
